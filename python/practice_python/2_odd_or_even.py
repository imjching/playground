"""
Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number
is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.
Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when
divided by 2?

Extras:

If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.
Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check). If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message
"""

number = int(raw_input("Please enter a number: "))

if number % 2 == 0: # Even
  print "This is an even number!"
else:
  print "This is an odd number!"
