// Exercise 25: Converting from Arrays to Trees

// When information is organized in a tree like a JSON expression, relationships
// point from parent to child. In relational systems like databases,
// relationships point from children to their parents. Both ways of organizing
// information are equivalent, and depending on the circumstances, we might get
// data organized in one way or another. It may surprise you to learn that you
// can use the 5 query functions you already know to easily convert between
// these representations. In other words, not only can you query arrays from
// trees, you can query trees from arrays.

// We have 2 arrays each containing lists, and videos respectively. Each video
// has a listId field indicating its parent list. We want to build an array of
// list objects, each with a name and a videos array. The videos array will
// contain the video's id and title. In other words we want to build the
// following structure:

// [
//   {
//     "name": "New Releases",
//     "videos": [
//       {
//         "id": 65432445,
//         "title": "The Chamber"
//       },
//       {
//         "id": 675465,
//         "title": "Fracture"
//       }
//     ]
//   },
//   {
//     "name": "Thrillers",
//     "videos": [
//       {
//         "id": 70111470,
//         "title": "Die Hard"
//       },
//       {
//         "id": 654356453,
//         "title": "Bad Boys"
//       }
//     ]
//   }
// ]

// Note: please make sure when creating objects (both lists and videos) that
// you add properties in the same order as above. This doesn't impact the
// correctness of your code, but the verifier expects properties to be created
// in this order.

function() {
  var lists = [
      {
        "id": 5434364,
        "name": "New Releases"
      },
      {
        "id": 65456475,
        "name": "Thrillers"
      }
    ],
    videos = [
      {
        "listId": 5434364,
        "id": 65432445,
        "title": "The Chamber"
      },
      {
        "listId": 5434364,
        "id": 675465,
        "title": "Fracture"
      },
      {
        "listId": 65456475,
        "id": 70111470,
        "title": "Die Hard"
      },
      {
        "listId": 65456475,
        "id": 654356453,
        "title": "Bad Boys"
      }
    ];

  return lists. // complete this expression
}

// Looks like you figured out that you can use map and filter to join two
// different arrays by a key. Now let's try a more complex example...
