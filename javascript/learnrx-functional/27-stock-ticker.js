// Exercise 27: Stock Ticker

// Let's try an easier question. Let's say we have a collection of all of the
// prices for NASDAQ stocks over time. Every time the price of a stock changes
// on the NASDAQ ticker an entry is added to this collection. Let's say that
// ten days ago you bought shares in Microsoft, and now you want to print all
// of the MSFT share prices since then. Filter the collection for MSFT trades
// starting from ten days ago and print each price record (including the time
//   stamp) using the print() function. Note: this is not a trick question.
// It's as easy as it seems.

// // The pricesNASDAQ collection looks something like this...
// var pricesNASDAQ = [
//   // ... from the NASDAQ's opening day
//   {name: "ANGI", price: 31.22, timeStamp: new Date(2011,11,15) },
//   {name: "MSFT", price: 32.32, timeStamp: new Date(2011,11,15) },
//   {name: "GOOG", price: 150.43, timeStamp: new Date(2011,11,15)},
//   {name: "ANGI", price: 28.44, timeStamp: new Date(2011,11,16)},
//   {name: "GOOG", price: 199.33, timeStamp: new Date(2011,11,16)},
//   // ...and up to the present.
// ];

function(pricesNASDAQ, printRecord) {
  var microsoftPrices,
    now = new Date(),
    tenDaysAgo = new Date( now.getFullYear(), now.getMonth(), now.getDate() - 10);

  // use filter() to filter the trades for MSFT prices recorded any time after 10 days ago
  microsoftPrices =
    pricesNASDAQ.
      filter(function(priceRecord) {   // finish this expression

  // Print the trades to the output console
  microsoftPrices.
    forEach(function(priceRecord) {
      printRecord(priceRecord);
    });
}

// Notice that the console is changing over time. Now look at the time stamps on
// the stock prices. We're displaying stock prices sampled after we ran our
// program! How could our array have contained stock price records from the
// future? Did we accidentally rip a hole in the space-time continuum?

// The solution to the riddle is that pricesNASDAQ is not an array. Unlike an
// array, which can only store a snapshot of stock prices, this new type can
// react to changes and update over time.

// In the next section I'll reveal the inner workings of this magical type.
// You'll learn how you can use it to model everything from mouse events to
// asynchronous JSON requests. Finally I'll show you how you can query this
// type using the 5 query functions you already know. It's about time we gave
// this magical type a name...
