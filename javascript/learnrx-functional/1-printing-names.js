// Exercise 1: Print all the names in an array

function(console) {
  var names = ["Ben", "Jafar", "Matt", "Priya", "Brian"],
      counter;

  for (counter = 0; counter < names.length; counter++) {

// Ask yourself this question: did we need to specify the order in which
// the names were printed? If not, why do it?
