// Exercise 34: HTTP requests

// Events aren't the only source of asynchronous data in an application. There's
// also HTTP requests. Most of the time HTTP requests are exposed via a
// callback-based API. To receive data asynchronously from a callback-based API,
// the client typically passes a success and error handler to the function. When
// the asynchronous operation completes, the appropriate handler is called with
// the data. In this exercise we'll use jQuery's getJSON api to asynchronously
// retrieve data.

function($) {
  $.getJSON(
    "http://api-global.netflix.com/queue",
    {
      success: function(json) {
        alert("Data has arrived.");
      },
      error: function(ex) {
        alert("There was an error.")
      }
    });
