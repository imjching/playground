# Developer's Zone

Just a fancy way of stating an experimental repository.

This repository contains all of the stuff that I'm currently exploring, or have explored. These includes programming fundamentals, code examples, programming challenges, and projects.

*NOTE:* Codes here will be overloaded with comments, even if some of them are explicit.
